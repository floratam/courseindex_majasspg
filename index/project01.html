        <h2> project 01 - confounding tools </h2>

        <h3> prompt </h3>

        <p> 
            this project asked us to design a poster about one, life under covid or two, how we see the future of design with a twist - 
            we were not allowed to use software explicity intended for design!
        </p>

        <h3> concept </h3>

        <p>
            i chose to form my piece around my revisiting of childhood nostalgia and ongoing isolation throughout the covid lockdowns,
            utilizing software that i employed very frequently during these bouts of loneliness. 
        </p>

        <h3> drafts </h3>

        <p>
            throughout the project, i experimented with several programs, making several iterations and learning how to utilize these
            non-intentional design softwares to my advantage. there was a lot of learning through making, meaning I was very much exploring
            the nature of these programs in a design-focused lens, which strayed far from their intended use.

        <h3> final </h3>

        <p>
            out of all three, this is the final iteration i chose, as i thought the composition was the strongest and it combined all the 
            parts of my experience in the most effective way to communicate my message, i believe.
